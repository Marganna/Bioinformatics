Bioinformatics is computer science applied to biology.  Application of algorithms, data structures
and machine learning to analyse DNA,proteins and evolutionary history. 

DNA & Protein

DNA == Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid which stores all the required information for a living, grouth and 
function. DNA is made of of a chain of nucleotidies, and each of them consists of a sugar [deoxyribose]
a phosphate group and one out of four nucleobases [ Adenine=A, Cytosine=C, Guanine=G and Thymine=T]
The helical strands are composed of deoxyribose sugar and phosphate groups usually called the "backbone" of 
the DNA molecule. Each rung has 2 nucleobases, wich attach the strands together.
Adenine can only pair with Thymine, and Guanine only Cytosine.

DNA sequence of characters 

A short segment [nibble] of DNA could be represented by a sequence of characters. Only A and T or G and C are 
able to be opposite each other. We can represent DNA sequence by a single sequence of chars. E.g. AACGTCGA

The size

The size of DNA is mesured in number of base pairs which varies from species to species, in 10.000s to 100 
billions of range. Humans have approximetely 3.2 billion compressed coiled form to fit inside the cell nucleus.

Replication and mutations

As the cells are being continously destroyed and created, each cell contains a copy of DNA which needs to be copied
for a new cell to be created. Thus 2 strands are seperated, after which each of them serves as a template for the 
construction of its complementary strand. After the construction 2 copies of the DNA are aquired. 
In the process of reproduction replication and combinationa needs as well. During the replication some errors may
occur [==mutation] which are defined from single-nucleotide to large section of the DNA getting copied twice or
deleted.

Proteins

Proteins ability to perform a specific function, is dependent on its shape and structure. DNA can be blueprint
for protein [could be building blocks of life]  construction. 

Structure of protein

Protein == coprises amino acids chains [peptide] and there are 20 amino acids. The sequence of amino acids that make up a 
particular enviroment and to other molecules.
